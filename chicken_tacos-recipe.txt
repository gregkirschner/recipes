Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. In a small bowl, 
combine the chili powder, coriander, garlic powder, cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. 
Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken with the 
spice mixture and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
